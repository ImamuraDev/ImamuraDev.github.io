  DFE is a web application that I helped create as part of my high school coding club. It was developed over a few weeks for the 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC), and tied for first in the high school division. It aims to solve one of the problems provided by the government and various companies, out of which we chose to create a website that lists assorted government projects in order to allow someone to view the status and various details of each project, including links to other related projects which are visualized on the page.

  DFE was created through Django, a Python web framework. As this was during COVID, development was also mostly remote, over Discord. During this project, I worked on various Python elements of the project, as well as a few short JavaScript functions.

  This project allowed me to continue practicing my skills in Python. It also served as a brief foray into JavaScript for me, though I wouldn't say I completely understood the language from just this experience. It also continued to give me valuable experience in developing as a team, especially remotely.
