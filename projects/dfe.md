DFE is a web application that I helped create as part of my high school coding club. This project served as a brief foray into JavaScript for me as well as continued to give me valuable experience in developing as a team, especially remotely.

DFE was created through Django, a Python web framework. It was developed over a few weeks for the 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). It aims to solve one of the problems provided by the government and various companies, out of which we chose to create a website that lists and manage various government projects in order to allow someone to view the status and various details of each project, including links to other projects which were visualized on the page.
