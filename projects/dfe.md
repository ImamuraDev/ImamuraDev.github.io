DFE is a web application that I helped create as part of my high school coding club. This project served as a brief foray into JavaScript for me as well as continued to give me valuable experience in developing as a team, especially remotely.

DFE was created through Django, a Python web framework. It was developed over a few weeks for the 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC).
