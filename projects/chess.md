---

For my latter three years in high school, I served as the Vice President of the Chess Club. As a part of this, I was required to attend weekly meetings on out-of-school time to discuss the affairs of the club with other VPs, as well as fill out most if not all of the paperwork relating to club matters and affairs. During this period I also was a member of various other clubs, such as our high school's Coding Club.
