  For my latter three years in high school, I served as the Vice President of the Chess Club. I was one of four student officers who ran club affairs (the other three titles being president, treasurer, and secretary). 

  As a part of this, I was required to attend weekly meetings on out-of-school time to discuss the affairs of the club with other club's VPs, as well as fill out most if not all of the paperwork relating to club matters and affairs. I was also involved with decision making for our own club as well as any events that we wished to hold. During this period, I also was a member of various other clubs, such as our high school's Coding Club, and I also served as the treasurer of the Math Club for a year.

  From this, I gained valuable experience with club management, communication, and leadership. Through juggling various responsibilities such as homework and club duties, I also learned a lot about time management and multitasking.
