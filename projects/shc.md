SHC is a web application that I helped create as part of my high school coding club. During this project, I worked on a variety of the python functionalities included in the project, which helped me further my understanding of the language.

DFE was created through Django, a Python web framework. It was developed over a few weeks for the 2019 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). It aims to solve one of the problems provided by the government and various companies, out of which we chose to create a website that tracked the status of various electric vehicle charging stations and visualized this data to show which ones were having issues or not, as well as which ones were going unused.
