## Introduction

Over the past few years, the use of AI programs throughout the general populace has increased exponentially, with large effects in a variety of sectors. However, though there may exist many potential upsides to such widely available technologies, there are also many detriments. One such unforeseen consequence was the use of tools like ChatGPT, compounded by the global pandemic and subsequent rise in online classes, creating the perfect storm for students across the globe to skip the effort and just ask some AI program for the answers to their questions.

For some fields, this does not matter as much, but for others, such as software engineering, applications such as ChatGPT or Github Copilot can have a profound effect on student’s performance, enabling them to “complete” assignments or work that they otherwise should not have. Though I will admit I have used tools like ChatGPT in the past for (required) classes that I didn’t really care about, I do think that the use of AI tools like ChatGPT is an overall detriment to the learning process if not used correctly.


## Personal Experience with AI

Throughout ICS 314, I did not use AI nearly at all, even though I would much rather say that in absolutes. As previously mentioned, the use of AI to easily solve your problems detracts from the learning experience and detracts from actually going through and figuring out how to do things yourself. You do not gain the experience and knowledge of going through code and figuring out how things work and what doesn’t work. As such and as a computer science major who actually cares about the subject, using AI tools as a serious thought hardly even crossed my mind, and I thusly did not use it at all for any class activities including:

1. Experience WODs
    - Simply figured out any pressing issues by working it out myself or watching provided explanation video.
2. In-class Practice WODs
    - Prefer to prepare for real WODs by doing practice WODs in same style I would do real WODs, without AI. Also mostly didn't need help, and if so, just collaborated with table.
3. In-class WODs
    - Easy enough to do just based on assignments and TA practice WODs, so no need for AI help.
4. Essays
    - I'll expand upon my thoughts for AI usage in writing later, but in short, AI shouldn't be used for essays in my opinion.
5. Final project
    - Briefly used for slight troubleshooting as mentioned below, but otherwise did not use AI since I generally just do not use AI for coding.
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
    - Didn't really need, class assignments and experience were good enough to learn concepts. For outside concepts like libraries, just read the docs.
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
    - Didn't really ask or answer any questions, but wouldn't rely upon AI to formulate ideas for me anyways.
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
    - Similar to above, didn't really ask or answer any questions, but wouldn't rely upon AI to formulate ideas for me anyways.
9. Coding example
    - Didn't need any help or examples from AI, if any examples were needed they were provided.
10. Explaining code
    - Prefer to read through code and come to an understanding myself.
11. Writing code
    - Prefer to write my own code so that I can learn more and gain more experience rather than have an AI do it for me.
12. Documenting code
    - I probably have a better idea of what my code is for rather than AI. For documenting other people's code, see no. 10.

 In all of the aforementioned instances, I much rather preferred to try and figure out the issue myself, giving myself a greater understanding of the systems involved. Also, frankly, I just didn't need it, especially for the (practice and real) WODs, which I found easy enough to do with knowledge from doing homeworks and practice WODs. There is one sole exception to my avoidance of AI throughout this course, a single instance where I tried to troubleshoot some errors (13. Quality assurance) during the final week of HACC, as our group rushed towards a hasty implementation of things. I did this because my group all utilized ChatGPT heavily throughout our Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC) project, and I wanted to try and see if it was worth a shot. Moreover, I was running into heavy issues that were preventing me from implementing things, on a very limited timeframe.

As such, I posted my code into the prompt, along with a description and occasionally an error message (the exact statements I have forgotten). I will admit that it eventually did help solve some of my problems (with code snippets), which I had spent quite some time trying to figure out. However, it also often could not completely diagnose the problem, if at all, leaving me to figure things out myself. Overall, I would say it was worth it for such a time-duressed and hard-to-solve issue, but generally not something I would prefer, since I could work it out given enough time. (For clarity in 14. Other usages, I did not use it for anything else, for the reasons mentioned above.)


## Impact on Learning and Understanding

My thoughts on AI on educating and learning can be summed up as follows: artificial intelligence programs are a crutch to students. Yes, they can be useful when first learning a subject and to help explain things (or bugs) that you would not otherwise be able to understand, similar to how a child might need training wheels when first learning to ride a bike. But if you continue to use your crutches even after you learn to walk, eventually you won’t be able to walk without them. I would also concur that when used correctly, AI can be a great boon in a variety of situations. However, in the overwhelming majority of scenarios—particularly with unmoderated usage by lazy students—the use of AI hinders learning, as it is abused and overused.

Take for instance, my usage of ChatGPT during the HACC. When I tried it, I used it only to troubleshoot errors, which I would say is a fair use of AI. However, even in this minimal usage of it, I didn’t really take the time to look at what exactly was the difference that caused the error to be resolved, and just moved on due to time constraints. This caused me to have a lesser understanding of the situation than if I had solved it manually, which could be rectified if I had more time to figure out what had changed that caused it to work.


## Practical Applications

There are many ways in which AI can be both ethically and effectively utilized in real world projects. However, AI can have a similarly detrimental effect depending on how it is utilized. For instance, my group mates for the HACC, who had on multiple occasions mentioned that they had used ChatGPT to write code, have also said that they do not fully understand sections of their code. As you can imagine, it makes it exceedingly more difficult to understand someone else’s code when even they don’t know what it does.

Moreover, one field that I particularly disagree with the usage of AI in is writing (essays). Perhaps this is just a personal gripe as a semi-experienced writer, but I find that just asking ChatGPT to whip up something professional sounding with a bunch of buzzwords and claiming it as your own is frankly insulting to people who actually put in the time to write down their thoughts. While we were writing necessary documentation for the HACC, one group member thought it prudent to only contribute instantaneous, giant paragraphs of information to answer the question, through what I can only assume was ChatGPT. I had to go through these paragraphs, removing overconfident buzzwords while also adding in actual necessary information that was missed.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Since I have already discussed the collaborative challenges I have come across with regards to AI in this course, I suppose I shall speak instead to more individual limitations of AI in general. The most common and obvious answer is, of course, that AI is not always correct. Particularly for complex and multifaceted problems, it can have trouble completing your request correctly. It might also not return everything in the exact form that you require. I could go on about generalities and things that I have heard, but in all honesty I really have not utilized AI that much for this class, so I don’t have much to say in this section.


## Comparative Analysis

The comparison between “traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education,” is an interesting question, though I do think the prompt for this section could be more detailed since I have no clear idea of what “AI-enhanced” teaching means. I assume it just refers to integration of AI into teaching, although to what degree or extent I similarly have no idea.

Nonetheless, going off a similar thought as to that in the “Impact on Learning and Understanding” section, I would say that traditional teaching methods are probably better in general. Usage of AI while learning can be beneficial and help you to understand things, but only if used correctly and preferably sparingly. Not to restate everything, but AI is a crutch and is detrimental to understanding of content when overused. I do think that the justification used in this class of “in the real world, you have access to internet/AI too” is not entirely wrong, but I think that for a better educational experience you should at least limit the usage of it in some capacities.


## Future Considerations

<img width="700px" src="../img/pandora.jpg">

A somewhat corny but quite accurate analogy that I have heard of widespread use of AI likens the unleashing of AI chatbots and similar user interfaces to that of the opening of Pandora’s box. Whether we like it or not, AI programs like ChatGPT are here to stay. This is especially true for a field like software engineering, which not only is tied to the development of AI, but is also heavily impacted by it due to the code writing functionalities provided. As such, whether you include it in the teaching methods or not, regulate it or not, it will be used by students to help write their code, while also becoming better and better at it. What particular policies and practices are in place are up to those running the course, but I personally would advocate for a more controlled usage, if at all, of AI tools, since I believe that overreliance on it may lead to a wave of, on average, less competent programmers.


## Conclusion

To conclude, this essay is not meant to be a denouncement of the use of AI technology. There are certainly many great applications of AI tools throughout the world and software engineering. However, particularly with the context of education in mind, I do think that it is of vital importance to pay heed to the usage of AI, as though people may benefit from the correct usage of it, it is far too easy to just ask it to do everything for you and learn nothing in turn. I have no easy, system-wide solutions to this problem besides bettering individual understanding of the issue, but solving that is beyond my scope as just a student anyways.
