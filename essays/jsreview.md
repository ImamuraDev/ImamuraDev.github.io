Many people would tell you that, despite the similarity in names, Java and JavaScript are very different languages. Yet when I first started JavaScript in high school, I was still skeptical; surely they must be at least a little similar, a reason for the name. I was able to create a few simple functions that were needed for a project, but I never really understood the language on a practical level. After going through the freeCodeCamp course and gaining a much better understanding of the subject, it has become clear to me how versatile and flexible JavaScript really is.

Of course, one of the main draws of JavaScript is that you are able to use it alongside HTML and CSS to give a website true functionality; it is one of the few languages able to interface in this way. This makes it extraordinarily useful for practical applications. But I also noticed that JavaScript has many useful features which are not necessarily found in other languages. Not needing to declare variable and return types, access to string characters through simple bracket notation, and similar for loop notation to other languages; features which made the language very intuitive to learn, at least for someone with experience in a few other languages already. In addition, it provides multiple ways to do things, such as being able to do if, else if, and else statements, but also being able to use switch statements if you want/need to. Moreover, there were many features in the ES6 portion of the course that, though I may not personally be presently comfortable enough to use, show the scalability and various in-depth options offered to those who use the language regularly. Overall, JavaScript seems to be a very useful, intuitive, and versatile language that I will almost certainly continue to use in the future, especially as the language continues to evolve.

As for athletic software engineering, the approach that we are using to learn in class, I must admit I am not so enthusiastic. So long as you maintain good time management, I find it hard to imagine any practical scenarios where you would both find out a random problem and then be required to code the solution from scratch in only the next few minutes (bar a coding interview or perhaps some live service maintenance, but nonetheless). However, after taking the practice WODs, which were quite useful as practice exercises for both the language and the actual WOD, as well as the first WOD earlier today, they do seem reasonable, at least if they remain fairly easy exercises. So long as they remain focused on the basics and practicing the content of what we are learning, rather than delving into some over-complex algorithm that might take you a while to figure out, I feel pretty comfortable with them, even if I generally donâ€™t like timed content.
